**Problem 1**
1. 10000000000n^2 vs n^3

   n^3 is greater because we 3>2 and we don't really care about coefficients.
2. (n^2)*log(n) vs n(log(n))^10

	a  
4. n^logn vs 2^sqrt(n)

	naskd
5. 2^n vs 2^(2n)

	these are asymptotically the same because when we ignore the coefficient for 2n, the order of growths for both are the same.

**Problem 2**

isPrime(n): 
  for(i = 2, i*i <= n; i++) {
    if(n % i == 0) {
      return false
    }
  return true
